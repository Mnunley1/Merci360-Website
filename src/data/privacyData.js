        As you use Merci, we collect certain information about you and the services
        you use. The information we collect falls into three different categories:
        (1) information you give us; (2) information we collect from you
        automatically when you use Merci; and (3) information we collect from other
        sources. In some cases, if you choose not to provide us with requested
        information, you may not be able to access or use Merci or certain functions
        or features.

          from you before permitting you to use Merci so we can verify your identity,
          address or other information, or to manage risk and compliance throughout
          our relationship. We also may ask for certain personal information from you
          for the purpose of providing to you content and/or services that you
          request. For example, we may solicit customer feedback regarding Merci so
          that we can improve our service or share information about other products
          and services that may be of interest to you. We also request your name and
          e-mail address each time you contact us by clicking on the “Contact Us”
          link. If you contact us to with questions or to report problems or
          inappropriate actions of others we may keep records of the information you

          videos, photos or graphics) you send or receive using Merci, including
          those you wish to share to social media. We also use personally
          identifiable information to provide you with the information or content
          that you have requested, and, in some cases, to contact you about our
          programs, products, features or services. We may use some of personally

          We offer Merci to you free of charge, but in order for us to continue doing
          so, we have to rely on revenue from other sources. For example, our
          business partners who use information collected by us, may use it for
          purposes of their own internal review of employees and customers. Another
          example, our business partners may use it for marketing their products or
          services to you. We may sell or provide the information you give us,
          including personally identifiable information and anonymous, aggregated
          information with other companies. For example, we may pass along your email
          address to a business partner you reviewed, which the business partner may
          use to follow up with you on your comment or, consistent with the business
          partner’s privacy policy, send you information about their products or
          services. Although we take commercially reasonable steps to help ensure our
          business partners comply with their legal obligations with respect to
          personally identifiable information, we cannot control—and are not
          responsible for—their use of information after we receive it.

          We may provide access to your personally identifiable information when
          legally required to do so; to cooperate with police investigations or other
          legal proceedings; to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of Merci;
          to limit our legal liability and protect our rights; or to protect the
          rights and safety of visitors to the Website, users of the App, or the
          public. In those instances, the information is provided only for that

          profile and be better recognized by other users trying to review them. In

          when giving a review to other users of the app if you choose to not share
          your Profile Picture/Avatar, First Name and Last Name. If a user keeps
          their settings as anonymous, Company will still be able to see the full
          details of each user as well as all the details provided in a Give and
          Receive post. If you volunteer to share any personal information in your
          posts, review, photo or video that you create, you acknowledge that you
          have given up your right to privacy, and Company is not responsible for
          your release of your information.
